        [Intro]
        You good, T-Minus?<br>
        
        [Refrain]<br>
        Niggas been countin' me out<br>
        I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips<br>
        I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list<br>
        I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit<br>
        The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit<br>
        The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit<br>
        The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty<br>
        But that's how I like it, you all on my dick<br>
        
        [Verse 1]<br>
        I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get<br>
        I do not snort powder, I might take a sip<br>
        I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip<br>
        I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish<br>
        I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death<br>
        I got a few mil' but not all of them rich<br>
        What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?<br>
        What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?<br>
        That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit<br>
        Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips<br>
        Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist<br>
        This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift<br>
        Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss<br>
        They act like two legends cannot coexist<br>
        But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'<br>
        If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit<br>
        It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame<br>
        It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same<br>
        It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers<br>
        It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane<br>
        Everything grows, it's destined to change<br>
        I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came<br>
        I hope that you scrape every dollar you can<br>
        I hope you know money won't erase the pain<br>
        To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now<br>
        Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground<br>
        I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style<br>
        I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now<br>
        Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice<br>
        Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise<br>
        This year gon' be different, I set my intentions<br>
        I promise to slap all that hate out your voice<br>
        
        [Refrain]<br>
        Niggas been countin' me out<br>
        I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips<br>
        I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list<br>
        I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit<br>
        The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit<br>
        The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit<br>
        The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty<br>
        But that's how I like it, you all on my dick<br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        I just poured somethin' in my cup<br>
        I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel<br>
        Promise I am never lettin' up<br>
        Money in your palm don't make you real<br>
        Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck<br>
        I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel<br>
        If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck<br>
        Pistol in your hand don't make you real<br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        I'm dead in the middle of two generations<br>
        I'm little bro and big bro all at once<br>
        Just left the lab with young 21 Savage<br>
        I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch<br>
        Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak<br>
        Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville<br>
        Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest<br>
        I wish that he had more guidance, for real<br>
        Too many niggas in cycle of jail<br>
        Spending they birthdays inside of a cell<br>
        We coming from a long bloodline of trauma<br>
        We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal<br>
        We hurting our sisters, the babies as well<br>
        We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well<br>
        Distorted self image, we set up to fail<br>
        I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga<br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        I just poured somethin' in my cup<br>
        I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel<br>
        Promise I am never lettin' up<br>
        Money in your palm don't make you real<br>
        Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck<br>
        I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel<br>
        If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck<br>
        Pistol in your hand don't make you real<br>
        
        [Outro]<br>
        Money in your palm don't make you real<br>
        Pistol in your hand don't make you real<br>
        Money in your palm don't make you real<br>
